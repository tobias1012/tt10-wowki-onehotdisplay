## How it works

The project uses a simple circuit to ensure the input is one hot coded, then it uses combinatorial logic to display the number from the input (0-8) on a seven segment display.
## How to test

send a input through the pins and observe the 7 segment display

## External hardware
- 8 switch DIP switches for input
- 7 segment display
